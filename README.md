# Analyzing_the_Impact_of_Social_Media_on_Mental_Health
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of social media on mental health by examining social media usage patterns and their correlation with mental health issues. To achieve this objective, we will be using the Twitter dataset available on Kaggle
Problem Description:
Social media usage has become ubiquitous in modern society, and it has changed the way people communicate and interact with each other. Social media platforms such as Twitter offer a wealth of information on people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which can be used to better understand their mental health.
Deliverables:
The project's deliverables will include a comprehensive analysis of social media usage patterns and their correlation with mental health issues. Specifically, the project will:
1. Conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine the overall sentiment of Twitter users.
2. Identify patterns in the tweets related to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress.
3. Analyze the correlation between social media usage patterns and mental health issues.
4. Develop a model to predict mental health issues based on social media usage
